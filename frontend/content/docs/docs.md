### Scale learning at UMich

MTC/docs is a platform that aims to become a knowledge hub for all things UMich. We are starting with just EECS related content, with the hope of expanding to other popular areas of study like pre-medicine, or pre-dental tracks, etc.

Whether you are a commuter who doesn't know many people on campus, out-of-state and don't know what's going on, or you are just looking for some information, MTC/docs is here to serve your needs.
