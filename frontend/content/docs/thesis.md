# motivating story (important)

you need more than just a degree to get a job now, the michigan muslim community is tight-knit, and easy to find what you need, **_if you have the right connections, and enough time_**

lets consider muslim students studying or interested in roles in tech across the product development stack (product → design → engineering)

not everyone is in-state, from metro detroit, well-known family. whats the purpose in saying this? meaning that those who do have these things generally do not have difficulty finding connections, making friends, finding resources, etc. even **_the social “barrier for entry” is lower_**

muslims in our community **_generally_** have little to no difficulty getting access to education or pursuing it. our community is full of money, opportunity, and network powerful enough to change our communities, and eventually (beithnillah) the world. the knowledge is, has been, and will continue to be, at our fingertips — but we still dont take action, learn, and build. why? its bc we either 1. dont realize how much we can really do or 2. we do realize, but we take later rather than sooner

why dont we tap into the gold mine that lives within us **_early_**, and get individuals started on a road of really solving problems that benefit people across the world? the more ppl we make it easier for to start their road in building problem-solving software, or solving problems in general, the higher the likelihood we get a gem, or hopefully gems, who really will change communities

# problem(s)

so whats the main problem(s)? as seen bolded above ^

1. its become so easy to learn stuff now, that we just dont, or we half-ass it. and if we do try the pipeline is usually (gpt → google → youtube → possibly experiment → gpt → youtube → …)
2. our umich specific knowledge is scattered, accessible to those who are involved, but slightly less so to the shy, unknown muslim. it may just take them a little more time (months, couple years) to access what they need
3. we are, in general, divided.

# solutions

how can we solve these problems?

1. **lower the “barrier of entry” for building things, we learn by doing.** make it easier to build by guiding students on how building works out in industry. how ppl build startups. how building generates ideas, and ideas create startups, and startups help ppl. great documentation, great, practical explanations. see where this is going?
2. **author resources and consolidate everything in one spot.** make it easy for the shy person who doesnt meet ppl or make connections w upper classmen to learn what he/she needs to learn (and further encourage them to get involved)
3. **when you build, you need a team, when you build together, you have to unite.** inspire ppl to create things and no longer produce them (and do so with their brothers/sisters, respectively)

### devil’s advocate

1. “oh but chatgpt exists and its so easy to get information now”
   1. ok, google existed before, chatgpt just makes it easier to do stuff, but even still, only a small fraction of people really make stuff. 99% of ppl sit on their asses, we want the muslim world to be in the 1%
2. “i go to umich and i always found the resources i need”
   1. thats great, changes are ur from the area and know ppl already. or ur social and not shy and met ppl who helped you out. or u are shy and not social but you met someone who helped you out. thats not the story for everyone. there are muslims out there who dont fit the traditional michigander-suburbian archetype
3. “i dont get along with certain ppl”
   1. when one sees ppl working together doing better than they themselves are, they will analyze what made them successful. sure, they might be geniuses, sure they may have all the funding in the world. one can make many excuses, but the one who—works hard, works together, shows gratitude, and works with the cards they are dealt—can accomplish anything

# the big appeal

im wondering, in general, these problems have been around for a while, and there is no long-lasting evidence that it has been solved, or at least not successfully. granted, these problems are very general, but the more we think about how to solve them, we might find some more specific ways to attack and eliminate these issues at their source, or at least mitigate them.

if you are someone who has asked themselves the question: what is so fulfilling about SWE, PM, PD, etc (especially if you dont work in the healthcare industry)? then working on something like this might give you that fulfillment.

we help each other on a small scale. 1 nice guy teaches the younger guys what he learned from his mistakes, the younger ppl learn, some pass it on, others take it and leave. lets scale that up and out and see how much of a change we can make.
