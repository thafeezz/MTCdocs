# What is MTC?

[Muslim Tech Collaborative](https://muslimtech.org/) (MTC) is a home for muslims in tech to collaborate on solving problems, educating our youth, and leveling up our careers through our professional network and resources. MTC started at UC Berkeley, and has spread to 10+ other universities across the US, and now its here, at UMich.

We built this platform in hopes of achieving a few key goals:

1. A resource for current and future (and even past) students
2. An guided intro to CS (and hopefully other majors) at UMich
3. Put everything down, in one place
4. A long-lasting and extensible learning platform for the community
