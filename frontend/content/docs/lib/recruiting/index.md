# Recruiting

{%note%} this guide was written by a sophomore recruiting for internships, it will be updated with all relevant FT/NG information from multiple sources soon {%/note%}

This is mainly towards underclassmen, since I (the author) am still an underclassman. You should try to get an internship now, since it'll help a lot later on when you are a junior/senior. You can probably take my advice, since I have some level of credibility (have landed 2 internship offers as a sophomore, one at a F500, and one at a unicorn startup).

There are a few key rules and tips to landing an internship as an underclassman.

1. The hardest part is getting the interview.
2. Apply early, and apply often.
   1. This means checking Github repositories with internships religiously, every single day, multiple times a day. Apply as soon as you see a new job posting that you haven't applied to.
3. Beggars can't be choosers.
   1. If you haven't had any experience yet, you should be applying to anywhere in the US, at any salary (paid experience)
4. Make sure your resumé is good enough.

On the topic of resumés, a few things you should constantly be doing to revise your resumé are:

- asking upperclassmen/Muslim graduates to read over your resumé and give feedback, preferably people whose advice you trust since they have had some success
- adding your fall and winter courses to your resumé under relevant coursework, and adding the projects from that course if you need better projects
- DON'T NOT APPLY TO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU'RE "WAITING TO MAKE YOUR RESUMÉ GOOD"!!!!!
  - It's never going to be good if you keep waiting to apply to things, I promise.

Go to hackathons to build projects if you are too lazy to build side projects. It'll force you to go 0-1 in 24-36 hours, and it's usually going to sound good enough to put on your resumé. You don't necessarily need to mention that it was a group project.

I did an unpaid internship my freshman summer (before sophomore year). Did it help? Yes. Would I recommend? No.

Try applying to the mythical freshman/sophomore internships at big companies, since it never hurts to apply. To get something as a freshman, you will definitely need side projects on your resumé, whether they come from hackathons, etc. Your course projects will not be cool enough to land you anything great for the most part, unless you take a super interesting/hard upper level CS course.

I'd recommend emailing/reaching out or using nepo to land something as a freshman. Think about cold emailing some startups. Resources for that sort of thing will be added to this doc later.

Lastly, never settle: if you get an offer that isn't an absolute end game offer, first of all, congrats! Second of all, you can keep applying to only jobs that are better than your current offer, and using it as leverage to expedite/negotiate any further processes.
