## Intro

Take this with 370/376 - I recommend 370 if you want to take 482 (Operating Systems), or any other systems/low-level course as early as possible.

281 is important for recruiting for software engineering internships, and it will absolutely be a big asset to your Leetcode skills if you put in the effort.

Also, search [AJZHOU 281 IA notes](https://ajzhou.gitlab.io/eecs281/notes/) - this is a great resource.

## Lecture

They're really boring. I'd just read the lecture notes.

## Lab

Lab is required, and you don't need to really think too hard in lab. If you're struggling with a project, use your IA as a resource for questions. Otherwise, you can GPT all the lab questions (the rare hard ones) and you won't lose any understanding of the course content.

## Projects

There's no starter code. Don't freak out.

Approach the projects like exams. The staff is trying to test you on your knowledge of BFS/DFS, for example. Once you figure out what they're testing you on, and you realize that the spec is worded carefully to try and trip you up, then the projects seem less like creative, unguided endeavors and more like any other assignment. That being said, this strategy ruins the mystery of solving the projects like a movie hacker.

You should think about writing clean code split up into functions that all serve a specific purpose. Ask questions, check previously asked questions on Ed/Piazza, ask your friends, IAs, find out what data structures you need, and what data you need to keep track of to solve the problem. There's usually only one real "right" way to build the project.

Once you have written the main functionality, make a flow chart - what can happen given any input, what should be printed, and what should happen to underlying data structures? Write tests that cover every single one of these cases. Run these through the debugger - if you have no errors, congratulations! You got a perfect score. Every project is simple to get a 100 on, if you test properly, unlike 280 where it's a little harder to get a perfect score on the huge private test suite. Private tests aren't important in 281, they only reflect a tiny bit of your grade.

Follow the optimization rules, it's helpful for interviews sometimes, and 370 explains most of the optimization strategies.

## Exams

The exams are pretty hard. I'll focus on the FRQ sections: if you have done the projects well, the FRQ's usually aren't bad, except for the final exam's dynamic programming question. I'd recommend just writing every single DP problem ever previously shown and praying the one you get is similar. Or you could just study DP hard and figure out how to solve it.
