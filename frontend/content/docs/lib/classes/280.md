## Intro

Take this with 203, you'll thank me later.

280 is a big step up, especially if you're coming from ENGR 101. Don't fret, since they give a lot of time to acclimate to more C++. 280 is where you should probably focus on lecture - there isn't a great deal of content covered throughout the course, but learning the content well is crucial for your understanding of software for later on (later courses, JOB INTERVIEWS, etc).

## Lecture

For lecture, the Juett recordings (if available) - are perfect and suitable for all your needs. If you want to go all the way to North for lecture, feel free. Studio recordings are best.

## Projects

The most important thing you can do for projects in 280 is write a test suite that covers every imaginable outcome.
