## Intro

I'd take this with 281, since that's what I (the author) did.

## Lab

Lab is annoying, since you get a random group. However, you only need an 80% on the lab assignment, so it's pretty doable if at least one out of four partners is up to date on lectures.
Spend little energy worrying about lab.

## Homework

The homework is typically not horrible, most students do well. If you're up to date on lecture, you can do well on all the HW assignments. I'd recommend having the relevant studio lecture (or your notes) up on your laptop for reference while solving the homework, just so you can check if your logic makes sense.

## Projects

370 projects are much simpler than they sound, they're all straight forward, and really only one way to do them. Do not overthink the projects!

## Exams

Exams for this course are usually punishing. Stay up to date on lecture, and focus mostly on the written part when preparing, since the bulk of your grade comes from this section. Make a robust cheat sheet with at least one example of each type of FRQ (each topic).
