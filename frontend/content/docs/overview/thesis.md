## Motivating story

You need more than just a degree to get a job now, the Michigan Muslim community is tight-knit, and easy to find what you need, **_if you have the right connections, and enough time._**

Let's consider Muslim students studying or interested in roles in tech across the product development stack (product → design → engineering).

Not everyone is in-state, from Metro Detroit, well-known family. What's the purpose in saying this? Meaning that those who do have these things generally do not have difficulty finding connections, making friends, finding resources, etc. Even **_the social "barrier for entry" is lower._**

Muslims in our community **_generally_** have little to no difficulty getting access to education or pursuing it. Our community is full of money, opportunity, and network powerful enough to change communities at large. The knowledge is, has been, and will continue to be, at our fingertips — but there remains a lack of action to learn and build. Why? We either 1. don't realize how much we can really do or 2. we do realize, but we take later rather than sooner.

Why don't we tap into the gold mine that lives within us **_earlier_**, and get individuals started on a road of really solving problems that benefit people across the world? The more people we can encourage to start their journey of building problem-solving software, or solving problems in general, the higher the likelihood we get a gem, or hopefully gems, who really will change communities. The easier it is to drive down that road, the better.

## Problem(s)

So what's the main problem(s)? As seen bolded above ^

1. Knowledge is a commodity. The issue isn't learning, it's whether or not we choose to start.
2. Our UMich specific knowledge is scattered, accessible to those who are involved, but slightly less so to the shy, unknown person. It may just take them a little more time (months, a year) to access what they need and know what questions they should be asking.
3. We are, in general, divided.

## Solutions

How can we solve these problems?

1. **Lower the "barrier of entry" for building things, we learn by doing.** Make it easier to build by guiding students on how building works out in industry. How people build startups. How building generates ideas, and ideas create startups, and startups help people. Great documentation, great, practical explanations. See where this is going?
2. **Author resources and consolidate everything in one spot.** Make it easy for the shy person who doesn't meet people or make connections w/ upper classmen to learn what he/she needs to learn (and further encourage them to get involved). Easily show people how to leverage UMich specific knowledge to their benefit.
3. **When you build, you need a team, when you build together, you have to unite.** Inspire people to create things and no longer just consume (and do so with their brothers/sisters, respectively).

## Devil's advocate

1. "Oh but ChatGPT exists and it's so easy to get information now"
   1. Google existed before, ChatGPT just makes it easier to do stuff, but even still, only a small fraction of people really make stuff. 99% of the world is rotting, its easy to get ahead, we want the Muslim world to be the top 1%.
2. "I go to UMich and I always found the resources I need"
   1. That's great! But not everyone may share that experience. Maybe you are social or maybe you aren't, but somehow you found your way. We want to make it super easy for people to find what they are looking for.
3. "I don't get along with certain people"
   1. When one sees ppl working together doing better than they themselves are, they will analyze what made them successful. Sure, maybe they are abnormally smart, maybe they have a lot of resoureces, etc. But the one who--works hard, works collaboratively, shows gratitude, and works with the cards they are dealt-—can accomplish anything.

## The big appeal

I'm wondering, in general, these problems have been around for a while, and there is no long-lasting evidence that it has been solved, or at least not successfully. Granted, these problems are very general, but the more we think about how to solve them, we might find some more specific ways to attack and eliminate these issues at their source, or at least mitigate them.

If you are someone who has asked themselves the question: what is so fulfilling about SWE, PM, PD, etc (especially if you don't work in the healthcare industry)? Then working on something like this might give you that fulfillment.

We help each other on a small scale. 1 nice guy teaches the younger guys what he learned from his mistakes, the younger people learn, some pass it on, others take it and leave. Let's scale that up and out and see how much of a change we can make. Let's make UMich open source.
