## What is MTC?

[Muslim Tech Collaborative](https://muslimtech.org/) (MTC) is a home for muslims in tech to collaborate on solving problems, educating our youth, and leveling up our careers through our professional network and resources. MTC started at UC Berkeley, and has spread to 10+ other universities across the US, and now its here, at UMich.

We built this platform in hopes of achieving a few key goals:

1. A resource for current and future (and even past) students
2. A guided intro to CS (and hopefully other majors) at UMich
3. Put everything down, in one place
4. A long-lasting, extensible, and collaborative learning platform for the community

## MTC/docs

MTC/docs aims to make UMich knowledge "open source" through community collaboration.

It contains 2 main parts:

1. Library (MTC/lib)
2. Curriculum (MTC/c8m)

### MTC/lib

The MTC/lib is a place for all UMich related information (starting with EECS for now). Not sure about a professor? Check the library! Is EECS 482 _really_ that bad? How do I succeed in 281? What classes do I take? The library will answer all these questions with docs authored by other UMich students.

### MTC/c8m

MTC/c8m is a curriculum being developed by the MTC education team aimed to supplement the current UMich curriculum. If you've taken 281, think of ajzhou's notes, but for every class, plus some industry knowledge. How will this be possible? From community [contribution](/docs/contribute)!

It will cover tools used in industry, and how these tools connect to what is taught at UMich. Eg. GitHub, how it works, how that connects to distributed systems (taught in EECS 491), Docker, what it is, where do we find it in EECS, etc.
