# What is MTC/docs?

{%tip%}To read more about the thought process behind this platform (and why it's not just a notion doc), read the thesis [here](/docs/overview/thesis).{%/tip%}

### Scale learning at UMich

MTC/docs is a platform that aims to become a knowledge hub for all things UMich. We are starting with just EECS related content, with the hope of expanding to other popular areas of study like pre-medicine, or pre-dental tracks, etc.

Whether you are a commuter who doesn't know many people on campus, out-of-state and don't know what's going on, or you are just looking for some information, MTC/docs is here to serve your needs.

### UMich knowledge, open-sourced

MTC/docs relies heavily on community contribution. Knowledge about classes, course notes, explanations that make difficult topics easy, industry knowledge, job-hunting tips, etc. The more knowledge compiled within this platform, the more others will benefit. So if you feel you excel at something, or have experienced something that might be beneficial to someone else, please [contribute](/docs/contribute) to MTC/docs!

This platform was also built with the intention of becoming a community project--an opportunity that is available for those seeking to work on something with others that actively helps the community. Currently, it is barebones, with a few QoL features to be added soon, but the goal is for this platform to evolve more and more, and for it to be built by students.
