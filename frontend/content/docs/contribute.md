### Contribute to MTC/docs

{%callout%} To contribute to the content in this platform, please refer to the README on [GitHub](https://github.com/thafeezz/MTCdocs). {%/callout%}

Contributions to MTCdocs are highly encouraged. If you have advice on a class, a professor, course schedule, etc that you feel people will benefit from, please share!

### Why should I contribute?

Authoring docs will help other students get the knowledge they otherwise might not be able to get. I would encourage reading our [thesis](/docs/thesis) to truly get an idea of our mission. If you are able to write about advice, experience, etc, please take the time to do so, it will count as sadaqah jariah iA.

{%note%}MTC/docs welcomes docs that share opinions about classes/professors, but please be respectful and genuine with advice on how to succeed. The goal is to make it easier for people to succeed, not scare them away. {%/note%}

### Where do I start?

If you don't know how to organize within MTCdocs or aren't familiar with GitHub (learn more about GitHub [here](/docs/library/git)), write a page (markdown) and email it to me (thafeez@umich.edu). I'll take care of it from there.

The hope is that contributions will become easier as the platform develops iA, but for now, please bear with us.
